# time_step_based_implementation

Decoupling the infection rate and the step size of the simulation by multiplying the specified infection rate per seconds with the step size of the simulation (unit seconds / step). The simulation of the spread of the virus is still happening per simulated iteration, just as for the original first implementation.
